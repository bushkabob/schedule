# React Native Assingment Schedule

This React Native Expo app allows you to specify when your assingments for different classes are due. It then provides you an easy interface through which you can visualize all the assingment due dates that you have provided. It also provides a mechanism for selecting the color scheme that the app will use (that is the colors which represent your different classes) and, additionally, supports the system-wide "Dark" and "Light" modes.
